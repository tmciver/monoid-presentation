** Total Weight
Let's say I have a bunch of packages that need to be shipped.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
packages = [{'destination': '968 East Summit Court New Lenox, IL 60451',
             'weight': 11},
            {'destination': '75 South George Street Muskegon, MI 49441',
             'weight': 5},
            {'destination': '238 N. Holly Ave. Tampa, FL 33604',
             'weight': 4}]
#+END_SRC

In order to ship I need to calculate their total weight.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results pp
totalWeight = 0
for package in packages:
  totalWeight += package['weight']
totalWeight
#+END_SRC

* Abstraction
* Conclusion
