** Total Weight
Let's say I have a bunch of packages that need to be shipped.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
packages = [{'destination': '968 East Summit Court New Lenox, IL 60451',
             'weight': 11},
            {'destination': '75 South George Street Muskegon, MI 49441',
             'weight': 5},
            {'destination': '238 N. Holly Ave. Tampa, FL 33604',
             'weight': 4}]
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
In order to ship I need to calculate their total weight.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+HEADER: :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results value pp
totalWeight = 0
for package in packages:
  totalWeight += package['weight']
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Let's Do It a Little More Functionally
#+BEGIN_SRC python
weights = [package['weight'] for package in packages]

totalWeight = reduce(operator.add, weights, 0)
#+END_SRC

** Reducing/Folding
[[file:img/Left-fold-transformation.png]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
weights = [11, 5, 4] # 11 : 5 : 4 : []
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
totalWeight = add(add(add(0, 11), 5), 4)
#+END_SRC
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
totalWeight = add(add(add(0,
                          11),
                      5),
                  4)
#+END_SRC

** Any Over 10?
The shipping company charges extra if our shipment contains any package over 10.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
overTen = [weight > 10 for weight in weights]
anyOverTen = reduce(operator.or, weights, False)
#+END_SRC

** All Under 15?
But they give a rebate if all packages are under 15 (just go with it).
#+BEGIN_SRC python
underFifteen = [weight < 15 for weight in weights]
allUnderFifteen = reduce(operator.and, underFifteen, True)
#+END_SRC
