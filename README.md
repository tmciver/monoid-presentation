A [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation created using Emacs'
[Org-mode](http://orgmode.org/).  The presentation can be viewed
[here](https://tmciver.github.io/monoid-presentation).

## Building the Presentation

`ox-reveal`.  Then export it as a RevealJS presentation and open it in a browser
with `C-c C-e R B`.
